    <h2>Application of AI</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) has a wide range of applications in everyday
      life, from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. AI-powered virtual
      assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa use natural
      language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and
      respond to user queries, making it easier for people to access information
      and control their devices. Self-driving cars use sensors, cameras, and AI
      algorithms to navigate roads and avoid accidents, providing a safer and
      more convenient transportation option.
